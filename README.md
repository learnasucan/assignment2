# Assignment 2

This Xcode project includes a single scrolling page that uses 3 components: an image, a grid container, and a list container. All of these components are in array format.

Each component can have multiple values, and they can appear multiple times in random order. The grid container can have 2, 3, or 4 columns and 'n' rows, depending on the data.

To display the data on the screen, we use a JSON structure that is stored in the project itself. This JSON file will determine how many components there are and in what order they appear. Static data, such as the image URL, name, value, and description, will be part of this JSON structure.

I have used Xcode_14.2
